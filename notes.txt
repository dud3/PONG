// "Crappy PONG" -- step by step
//
// Step 9: Homework
/*
// Everything done

* Make the ball bounce off the left and right 
  edges of the playfield, instead of "resetting". +
  
* Add a scoring system! When the ball hits the
  left edge, the right paddle earns a point, and
  vice versa. Display each paddle's score, in
  "bold 40px Arial", at the top of the playfield +

* Prevent the paddles from moving out of the
  playfield, by having them "collide" with it. +
  
* Let the user also move the paddles horizontally
  i.e. left and right within 100 pixels of the edges,
  using the 'A' and 'D' keys for the left paddle,
  and   the 'J' and 'L' keys for the right paddle +
  
* Add a second ball, with half the velocity 
  of the first one. +
